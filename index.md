# NSW Government github pages template

### Background
This repo is a theme so that NSW Government designers to create prototype digital products (static or transactional) which are displayed using github pages.

### Tech
[NSW-uikit-starter](https://github.com/tjharrop/nsw-uikit-starter) is a fork of the DTA's [Uikit Starter](https://github.com/govau/uikit-starter) which, instead of being static HTML files, generates a NSW-branded theme for Jekyll, the Ruby on Rails static site builder used by github pages.

The whole Jekyll theme is available in [NSW-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/tjharrop/NSW-jekyll-theme).

You can use NSW-jekyll-theme without forking it, by referencing it as a remote theme.

This package is a demo of that, which you can import and modify.
